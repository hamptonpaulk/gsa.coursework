## 1.1   OVERVIEW OF KEY ASPECTS IN THE DESIGN PROCESS
-----

### 1.1.1  Identify the primary steps in the design process (i.e. conceptualize, prototype, test, analyze)	[T21C2]  [T21C3]  [CWS2]  [T8] [T11]  [SCC01]  [SCC10]

Each employers process is different but many of the core ideas will remain the same. Here is one approach to the process.

The following notes / steps came from *The Complete War Games Handbook* and from *http://www.alanemrich.com/*

1. **Concept Development** - you must determine at the very beginning what it is that you want to do. Development of a high concept, one-sentence marketing description, and hook(s) or essentially the foundation of your game. Once this is developed, you should NOT deviate from this plan. This is a good time to frame out the boundaries of your game.
2. **Research** - You will probably have done a little of this during the concept development stage. At this point, you must fill in as many of the gaps in your knowledge as you can.
3. **Integration & Prototype Research** - It is where you take all of the research material and your knowledge of game mechanics and integrate it into a prototype game. Answering questions like, “What, in general, will the pieces in this game be?” “How will they move?” “How will they interact with each other?” “How will the player(s) interact with the pieces?” “What’s the object of this game?” will help you define and arrange the Big Pieces together such that you’re satisfied that your Pyramid’s structure is straight and sound.
**4**. Prototype - Satisfied with the research of integrating your knowledge into the big pieces of your design, now it’s time to focus on the detail work, connect the synapses, and create something usable. This is where your focus zooms in from the forest to the trees.
5. **Rules (First Draft)** - Many people overlook this step, preferring to keep the rules in their heads for a while longer. They usually come to regret this. Now is the time to put together that first draft of your rules or a manual to your game. This will help you stay on task.
6. **Development & Playtesting** - This means playtesting and changing the game and rewriting the rules and taking a lot of abuse from people who would rather play games than work on them and don’t appreciate all the problems the poor designer has in getting anything done. You, the game designer, stay very involved in this step; it is a ‘hands on’ operation. This is where you play your own game with others and answer team member’s questions about your design and what they’re expected to do. You’ll hear a lot of “You needed to think this though” and “You left out what happens if this and that and then the other occurs” and all about other leaks that you didn’t catch while fixing the plumbing in Step 4. Important people that you trust and are working with on this game are getting their first look at “your baby” and seeing it as the crude Frankenstein monster that you’ve been able to cobble together thus far. You need to be able to get past their abuse and take their criticisms to heart if it will make a better game. The goal of this step is to redraft and rewrite over the game’s weak spots and prepare for the next step.
7. **Beta & Blind-Testing** - This is where you take your physical prototype and your written rules and send them out to somebody who can play the game without your presence. This is often very revealing. For computer games, this is the same as send a beta copy ‘out of house’ and having some fresh eyes see the game for the first time. The most critical thing to learn from new testers is their all-important ‘first experience’ with the game. Could they get into it easily? Was it intuitive? Where the general ergonomics friendly and not frustrating? Could they find the answers to their questions quickly and easily within the game’s components? In other words, where their first few minutes (say, up to a half-hour) with the game pleasant and enjoyable? If not, you’ve got a big problem to fix right there! After they’re used to the game, you’ll get feedback about what’s working and what’s not, both about the big pieces of the game’s design, as well as the minutiae players encounter. It will be difficult to make major changes at this point in the process, so a good designer has to be clever in applying solutions to real problems that are brought to his or her attention. When you reach this step, the best solutions are usually those that involve the least amount of work or changes; a clever tweak or cutting something out entirely is generally the right way to go.
8. **Editing** - This step occurs when all of your blind testing results have come back and have been integrated into the manuscript. Somebody else should now take over the manuscript and edit it. This also means trying to play the game with all of the final corrections and changes in an effort to smoke out as many gremlins as possible. What you need to do at this time is to join in the final playtesting, not make any changes greater than a subtle tweak that is easily incorporated and improves the balance of the game, and proof-read everything to make sure everyone’s got it right.
9. **Production** - If you are going to publish the game, this is the production step. This is where a million things can go wrong. Rules have to be laid out (and things can get scrambled there). The artwork has to be prepared from your prototype (and is subject to untold misinterpretations). There is a lot of potential danger in this stage. And a lot more proofreading for you to do. You can’t do enough proofing and hands-on inspection of every aspect of production. You should read all the ad copy, the box copy, the press releases, email interviews… everything that you can. If it is in writing and about your game, you’d better jolly well interject yourself into the process and proofread it if you have the opportunity. It’s important that nothing is said about the game that it doesn’t deliver.
10.  **Feedback** - This step is also extremely critical if you are going to design more games. This is the step where you systematically collect feedback from those who play your game to see where you went right and where you went wrong.
This is a heavy burden where more than one game designer has found himself or herself martyred at the stake. Remember, this is a step where the game is analyzed to tell you what you did right or wrong. It is very personal that way.
Critics of the game can get quite personal (abusively so). These are not just indiscriminate flaming idiots on the internet Newsgroups, nor even the critics of the so-called ‘legitimate’ hobby press. No, these will include your closest coworkers, your best friends, even your family! When there’s something bad to be said about your game, it’s going to seem like everyone you ever knew is beating up on ‘your baby’ and you’ll want to scream, “When will it all end?”
But it never ends until your game has been retired to obscurity, and even then it only dies down and never quite ends.

### 1.1.3  Explain the role of iteration in the design process	[CWS2]  [T8]  [T11]

It is important to know about the iterative design process in detail and how it relates to game development and design.

Notes in this section come from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design

Iterative design is a design methodology based on a **cyclic** process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.

Iterating allows us to adapt to changes or findings in our research quickly as well as responding to changes needed during playtesting.

### 1.1.4  Explain the difference between game mechanics and gameplay	[T21C8],  [T21C10]  [CRS2] [CWS2]  [NGSS3]  [NGSS8] [SCC01]

**Game Mechanics** - Game mechanics are constructs of rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state, thus providing gameplay. All games use mechanics; however, theories and styles differ as to their ultimate importance to the game. In general, the process and study of game design, or ludology, are efforts to come up with game mechanics that allow for people playing a game to have an engaging, but not necessarily fun, experience.

The interaction of various game mechanics in a game determines the complexity and level of player interaction in the game, and in conjunction with the game's environment and resources determine game balance. Some forms of game mechanics have been used in games for centuries, while others are relatively new, having been invented within the past decade.

**Game Play** - Arising alongside video game development in the 1980s, the term gameplay was used solely within the context of video or computer games, though now its popularity has begun to see use in the description of other, more traditional, game forms. Generally, gameplay is considered to be the overall experience of playing a video game excluding factors like graphics and sound[citation needed]. Game mechanics, on the other hand, is the sets of rules in a game that are intended to produce an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions tend to favor terms like game mechanics specifically to avoid gameplay since the latter term is too vague.

### 1.1.7   Analyze and evaluate the user experience of several game mechanics used in an existing game	[T21C12]  [CWS1] [SCC02.01]

Using Missle Command

### 1.1.8  Investigate the concept of "Interactive Narrative" and explain how/when it could pertain to game design	[T21C12]  [CRS2]  [CWS2] [CRI10]

As defined by [Stephen Dinehart](http://narrativedesign.org/2009/09/what-is-interactive-narrative-design/), Interactive narrative design combines ludology, narratology and game design to form interactive entertainment development methodologies. Interactive entertainment experiences allow the player to witness data as navigable, participatory, and dramatic in real-time: “a narratological craft which focuses on the structuralist, or literary semiotic creation of stories." Interactive Narrative design seeks to accomplish this via viewer/user/player (VUP) navigated dataspaces. Interactive narrative design focuses on creating meaningful participatory story experiences with interactive systems. The aim is to transport the player through play into the videogame (dataspace) using their visual and auditory senses.[22] When interactive narrative design is successful, the VUP (viewer/user/player) believes that they are experiencing a story.

The following Abstract sample was taken from http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~riedl/pubs/aimag.pdf

Interactive narrative is a form of digital interactive experience in which users create or influence a dramatic storyline through their actions. The goal of an interactive narrative system is to immerse the user in a virtual world such that he or she believes that they are an integral part of an unfolding story and that their actions can significantly alter the direction and/or outcome of the story.

### 1.1.9  Explain the relevance of ambiance and environment in game design	[T21C10]  [CRS2] [CWS2]  [SCC02.01]  

Ambiance and environment provide the base that helps to form your realistic game experience. Without background audio and effects your models and characters will seem lifeless to the player.

#### 1.1.10 	Determine the relevance of character development, backstory and attributes (power, speed, intelligence, empathy, etc.) in game design	[CRS2]  [NGSS8]  [T21C2], [T21C8]

As games continue to mature and become more sophisticated, the expectations for production values become higher. These production values include graphics, music, and story. Story is the result of character development: what happens to the characters as events transpire around them. Character development in and of itself isn't going to make your gameplay any better, but it will create a more satisfying experience because you're furnishing a more well-developed context, a more immersive world for the player to explore.

Full article and exercise can be found at:  http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130780/it_builds_character_character_.php


You can't read a review of an adventure game or shooter without seeing some kind of reference to the storytelling, the dialogue, the characters. Can you relate to the characters? Are they well-developed? Are they interesting? It's become an expectation, an industry norm. Cliches and stereotypes are unacceptable.

#### 1.1.11 	Differentiate basic game player types and objectives with examples (Thrill seekers, Socializers, Explorers, Achievers)	[T21C12]  [SCC02.01]

Massive data can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test)

#### 1.1.12 	Evaluate and describe various 2D & 3D, single & multi-user genre	[CRS2]  [NGSS3]

[Data Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre)

Video game genres are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences. A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their setting or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space.

As with nearly all varieties of genre classification, the matter of any individual video game's specific genre is open to personal interpretation. Moreover, each individual game may belong to several genres at once.

[Data Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres)

* 1 Action
* 2 Shooter
* 3 Action-adventure
* 4 Adventure
* 5 Role-playing
* 6 Simulation
* 7 Strategy
* 8 Sports

#### 1.1.13 	Explain the role of psychology and sociology on interactive design	[T21C10]  [CRS2] [CWS2]  [SCC02.01]

Cultural psychology is the study of how psychological and behavioral tendencies are rooted in and embodied in culture.[1] The main tenet of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable and mutually constitutive, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them.[2] As Richard Shweder, one of the major proponents of the field, writes, "Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion."

Cultural psychology relates directly to gaming and game design as we are designing to a target, to provide some form of escape through entertainment.

Each of the following: CPU, GPU, Memory, Storage will all need to be tested and adapted for gameplay. These elements will determine your LOD or level of detail needed for models, rendering distance, and so much more.

Use the Rendering statistics window in the editor to get the number of draw calls.

Simple Checklist to make Your Game Faster

- Keep vertex count below 200K..3M per frame when targetting PCs, depending on the target GPU
- If you’re using built-in shaders, pick ones from Mobile or Unlit category. They work on non-mobile platforms as well; but are simplified and approximated versions of the more complex shaders.
- Keep the number of different materials per scene low - share as many materials between different objects as possible.
- Set Static property on a non-moving objects to allow internal optimizations like static batching.
- Do not use Pixel Lights when it is not necessary - choose to have only a single (preferably directional) pixel light affecting your geometry.
- Do not use dynamic lights when it is not necessary - choose to bake lighting instead.
- Use compressed texture formats when possible, otherwise prefer 16bit textures over 32bit.
- Do not use fog when it is not necessary.
- Learn benefits of Occlusion Culling and use it to reduce amount of visible geometry and draw-calls in case of complex static scenes with lots of occlusion. Plan your levels to benefit from ccclusion culling.
- Use skyboxes to “fake” distant geometry.
- Use pixel shaders or texture combiners to mix several textures instead of a multi-pass approach.
- If writing custom shaders, always use smallest possible floating point format:
    fixed / lowp - for colors, lighting information and normals,
    half / mediump - for texture UV coordinates,
    float / highp - avoid in pixel shaders, fine to use in vertex shader for position calculations.
- Minimize use of complex mathematical operations such as pow, sin, cos etc. in pixel shaders.
- Choose to use less textures per fragment.
