## 36 Week Planning (Program Overview)

### Weeks 1 - 4 Core objectives

  **Game/Simulation  Industry 101**

  Industry operation basics includes understanding  of the various roles in the industry, importance of each role and how the organization  operates (phases, hierarchy and modus operandi) by type (indie, mid-­‐sized or corporate).

    - What are Games and Simulation- Custom Videos
    - Difference between Games and Simulation- Custom Videos, 5 or more short custom games with at least two of each type for practical understanding.
    - Core Roles & other Roles in these Industries- Custom Videos
    - Organization Types- Custom Videos


  **Building Schedule 101**

  First, the students are introduced to building a simple schedule and its importance which is realized through the entirety of this course. The concept includes work planning, time management  and self-­‐evaluation. I.e. They are asked to document the work assigned by the instructor, the time they estimate it would take and the actual time it took to complete the work. The motive is for students to be able to better estimate the time required for a given work by the end of the first month.

    - Importance of Building a Schedule- Custom Youtube Videos
    - Building a Schedule in Google Spreadsheet - Custom Youtube Video


  **Game Programing 101**

  Next, the students are tested for programming  interests by learning like how to use a game engine to develop a simple game. This is accomplished  by utilizing a partially built game and some video tutorial. Motive is to create/find interest, develop confidence and make programming  feel fun.

    - Introduction  to Unity Controls
    - Introduction to Unity Editor
    - First Game - Roll a Ball


  **Brainstorming 101**

  Finally, they are familiarized in the importance of team building and thinking structure and on how to constructively  brainstorm game features on a given game topic.


### Weeks 5 - 8 Core objectives

  **Programming Roles 101**

  This month, students are first reintroduced  to the similarities and differences in games and simulations and how they are tackled from programming  perspective. Additionally, students are introduced to various programming  roles and responsibilities  in the Games and Simulations industry.

  **Programing Basics**

  If students are new to programming  or to C# (C Sharp), then they are first introduced to programming  basics. [Optional]

    - C# Basics-    http://goo.gl/r7C6Ho

  **Learning UNITY**

  Upon grasping the basics, students further learn how to create two simple games, a survival shooter and a space shooter (can be reduced to a single game if programming  basics are taught). The games aim to provide understanding  of UNITY UI and additional features and tools and demonstrate ways of utilizing them. This month also educated on various Unity Scripts like creation and application of basic game and enemy A.I., enhancing player character controller, also building awareness of basic animation integration features in UNITY. The focus is learning the various options in UNITY engine and how they can be utilized to making a game or simulation.

    - Survival Shooter
    - Space Shooter
    - Pre-­builds -  assets can be found in the Unity website

  **Estimating Time**

  Additionally, Students are asked to plan and estimate time schedule for all assigned work/task. Segregate them into parts for micro managements  and finally log the actual time taken to complete each task. Focus is on the precision of time estimation and following of schedule thus improving time management  skills. [This is a recurring Task for all months on all tracks and will not be mentioned specifically henceforth]

    - Time Estimates - This requires no tutelage this month. Only a log to verify students’ effectiveness  in time management  and planning skills.  


### Weeks 9 - 12 Core objectives

  This month students learn UNITY physics which are essential to Simulations.

  **2D Platformer Game**

  This month, students learn how to create a simple 2D Platformer Game.

  **Collaborating with Art Team**

  Additionally, students plan and collaborate with an Art Track student to procure 2D assets to integrate in their 2D Platformer Game (Team consists of one Programmer and one Artist). Students are asked to replace a few objects of their choice from the game (minimum of two game objects and one Character) with Art Track’s assets. Assets and its requirement are discussed amongst the team and the discussed assets upon finalization are submitted as a report to the team’s course instructor. Students are responsible for procuring and replacing all discussed art assets. For the programming  team the emphasis is not on the quality of the art integrated, but in the procurement  and functionality of the assets and to verify that all the possible functionalities  provided by the artist are implemented

### Weeks 13 - 16 Core objectives

  **Stealth Game**

  Stealth game is split into 4 chapters teaching advanced techniques in UNITY including lighting, Inspector management,  Game Controller (Game AI), Player Character and animation controller, Triggers and Enemy AI. Upon learning these, students are further induced to advanced learning in UNITY Physics and its possible application in Simulation. This month completes the foundation to game and simulation programming  through UNITY.

  **Practice Research**

  The point is to keep the research extensive but fun something that game developers (consists of all professions involved in developing a game) would love to do. The research practices encouraged in this course involves playing games similar to the one planned to develop and observing the programming  measures taken in such games. Based on research further refining game features.

    - Self­‐Research - Students play and document their research on games from the same genre.

  **UNITY Animation Functions**

  By this time most of the animation functionalities  are already introduced. Objective now is to cultivate an understanding  of all the various animation functionalities  and its use based on situation. [This feature has been a topic of confusion even to advance UNITY users and hence readdressed] http://goo.gl/3UHt64

    - Custom Animations - Students are provided with custom animations for integrating into unity and assigning states in Animation Controller.

### Weeks 33 - 36 Core objectives

  **Game Design Core**

  Students are taught the 3 basic principles of game design that is to keep the game Simple, Intuitive and Fun. Simple means to take all the game mechanics and fine tuning it to the extent where there is no waste (unpolished or unintended design) in the game mechanics. Intuitive design represents that the game should speak for itself and convey design with minimal or no external aid/help (like tutorials, way pointers, etc.). And finally Fun which speaks to the interactive engagement and
  resulting rewards to the player. To satisfy these principle students are asked to Balance the game from the perspective of the player. To gain perspective developers (students) are asked to identify the target audience and research their needs, wants and expectations.

  **Quality Testing**

  Testing for quality in games implies answering if the game is able to run, if it can be completed, if it delivers fun/satisfaction.  This too can be understood through 3 simple procedures. First, the game design principles which was previously explained. Second, Bug Testing (White, Black and Grey Box testing) which is being performed by students in the previous months. And finally, UX testing (User Experience), is performed to check for the effectiveness  of the game. It confirms the functionality of the game by verifying Game Design principles, UI principles and game controls effectiveness.  The test then provides empirical data of whether the game is enjoyable or not.

  Based on the studies, students are advised to review their game and fine tune it accordingly

  This month focuses on polishing, publishing and presentation  of the game.
